# m0lecon-mini-challs

This repository contains all challenges developed for [m0lecon mini 2021](https://m0lecon.it/static/archive/2021/index.html), a cybersecurity competition for beginners.
Those were not developed by me directly, but by the whole team. This is a repository to publicly share the sources.


Inside every challenge's folder you will find one or both of those folders:
 - src: the sources for the challenge, don't read them if you don't want spoilers. You can launch every challenge with docker-compose up
 - dist: the files distributed to the players during the competition. You can view those as they are necessary for the solution

 If one of those folders is missing it is not required for the challenge
